1. Explain the money flow and the information flow in the acquirer market and the role of the main players.

1.Answer -

In the context of mergers and acquisitions (M&A), the acquirer market refers to the side of the transaction where one company (the acquirer or buyer) seeks to acquire another company (the target or seller) through various means such as purchasing its assets or acquiring its stock. The flow of money and the flow of information are critical aspects of this process, involving several key players:

Money Flow:

Acquirer: the buying company that intends to acquire the target company. The acquirer provides the funds required for the acquisition, either from its own resources, cash reserves or by raising debt or equity.

Target company: The company to be acquired. The target company receives payment from the acquirer in exchange for its assets, equity or other forms of consideration.

Investors: These are individuals, institutions or shareholders who may invest in the acquirer's financing activities, e.g. by purchasing shares in a public offering or by providing loans in the form of debt instruments.

Banks and financial institutions: these entities often play a critical role in facilitating the flow of funds. They can provide loans, bridge financing or lines of credit to the acquirer to support the acquisition.

Intermediaries: Investment banks, financial advisors and brokers act as intermediaries between the acquirer and the target company. They help structure the deal, provide valuation reports and help negotiate terms. They can also help secure financing from investors and financial institutions.

Information Flow:

Due diligence teams: both the acquirer and the target company assemble teams to conduct due diligence. These teams thoroughly analyze the financial, operational, legal and other aspects of the target company. This information flow is critical for the acquirer to understand the value, risks and potential synergies of the acquisition.

Legal and regulatory authorities: Regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States or equivalent bodies in other countries monitor the disclosure of relevant information to ensure transparency and regulatory compliance.

Internal Stakeholders: The management of the acquirer and the target are responsible for communicating with their respective boards and shareholders. They provide information on the reasons, benefits and risks associated with the planned acquisition.

Public announcements: Once the terms of the acquisition are agreed upon, a public announcement is published. This announcement communicates the basic details of the transaction to the public, including investors, customers, suppliers and the media.

Market analysts and media: Financial analysts, media and industry experts closely follow and analyze acquisitions. They provide insights, predictions and opinions that can influence the perception of investors and other stakeholders.

In summary, money flow in the acquisition market involves the movement of funds between the acquirer, the target company, investors, banks and other financial institutions. Information flow includes due diligence, regulatory disclosures, communications between internal stakeholders, public announcements, and analysis by market experts. All of these components play a critical role in shaping the outcome of the acquisition and its impact on the companies and stakeholders involved.



2. Explain the difference between acquirer, sub-acquirer and payment gateway and how the flow explained in question 1 changes for these players.



2.Answer - 

Acquirer:
An acquirer, often referred to as a merchant acquirer or acquiring bank, is a financial institution that works with merchants (businesses) to enable them to accept payments from customers using various payment methods such as credit cards, debit cards, and electronic funds transfers. The acquirer provides merchants with the necessary infrastructure to process transactions, including payment terminals, software, and connectivity to payment networks.

Sub-Acquirer:
A sub-acquirer, sometimes called a payment processor or payment aggregator, acts as an intermediary between merchants and acquirers. Sub-acquirers enable smaller merchants or businesses to accept electronic payments without directly establishing individual relationships with traditional acquirers. They aggregate transactions from multiple merchants and process them in one batch. This model is often used by online marketplaces, service providers, and other businesses with numerous smaller customers.

Payment gateway:
A payment gateway is a technology solution that securely handles the transfer of payment data between the merchant's point of sale (online or physical) and the payment processor or acquirer. It ensures that payment data is encrypted and transmitted securely, and plays an important role in authorising and processing transactions. Payment gateways are essential for online and e-commerce transactions.

Money flow for acquirer, sub-acquirer and payment gateway:

Acquirer: The acquirer receives transaction data from the merchant's point of sale. It processes the payment through the appropriate payment networks, verifies the legitimacy of the transaction, and transfers the amount to the merchant's account after deducting all fees.

Sub-Acquirer: In the case of a sub-acquirer, the process is slightly different. The sub-acquirer aggregates transactions from multiple merchants. It handles the authorization and processing of transactions on behalf of these merchants. The sub-acquirer then settles with the individual merchants, usually after deducting its fees.

Payment gateway: The payment gateway ensures the secure transmission of payment data from the merchant to the payment processor or acquirer. It also facilitates the authorization process by interacting with payment networks. Payment gateways often charge merchants for their services.

Information flow for acquirer, sub-acquirer and payment gateway:

Acquirer: The acquirer requires detailed information from the merchant about transactions, products, services, and prices. This information is used to ensure compliance with regulations and network rules. Due diligence is also performed to assess the merchant's risk profile.

Sub-Acquirers: sub-acquirers must collect information from their aggregated merchants to ensure proper processing. They also perform some level of risk assessment and due diligence on the merchants they service.

Payment gateway: payment gateways collect transaction data from the merchant, encrypt it and transmit it securely to the payment processor or acquirer. They also handle error messages, transaction status updates, and responses related to the payment process.

In summary, the acquirer, sub-acquirer and payment gateway each have different roles in processing electronic payments. The flow of funds involves the movement of funds between customers, merchants, acquirers or sub-acquirers, and payment networks, while the flow of information involves transaction details, compliance information, and risk assessment. The specific responsibilities and interactions are different for each actor, reflecting the complexity of the payment ecosystem.

3. Explain what chargebacks are, how they differ from cancellations and what is their connection with fraud in the acquiring world.

3.Answer - 

Chargebacks:
Chargebacks are a payment industry procedure whereby a cardholder disputes a transaction made with his or her credit or debit card and requests his or her card- issuing bank to reverse the transaction. Chargebacks are typically initiated by the cardholder for a variety of reasons, including unauthorized or fraudulent transactions, failure to receive goods or services, damaged or defective products, or disputes over the quality of items purchased.

In the event of a chargeback, the Cardholder's card-issuing bank will reverse the transaction and return the funds to the Cardholder's account. The acquiring bank (the bank that processes payments for the merchant) is then responsible for processing the chargeback and often forwards the chargeback notice to the merchant.

Cancelations:
Cancelations, on the other hand, refer to the voluntary cancelation of a transaction before it's fully processed or completed. Cancelations can occur for a variety of reasons, such as the customer changing their mind, the merchant being unable to fulfill the order, or other circumstances leading to the decision not to proceed with the transaction. Unlike chargebacks, which involve a dispute and often require intervention by the issuing bank, cancelations are usually initiated either by the customer or by the merchant itself.

Context of fraud:
Chargebacks are closely associated with fraud in the acquiring world, as they can be abused by dishonest individuals. The following explains how fraud is related to chargebacks:

Friendly Fraud: Friendly fraud, also known as chargeback fraud, occurs when a cardholder disputes a legitimate transaction with the intent of receiving a refund while keeping the item or service purchased. This can be unintentional (e.g., when the cardholder doesn't acknowledge the transaction) or intentional (e.g., when the cardholder claims not to have received the merchandise when in fact they did). Friendly fraud can result in financial losses for the merchant.

Genuine fraud: True fraud involves unauthorized transactions in which a criminal uses stolen card information to make purchases. When the legitimate cardholder discovers the fraudulent activity, they initiate a chargeback to reclaim their money.

Fraudulent chargebacks: In some cases, fraudsters manipulate the chargeback process to exploit vulnerabilities in the system. For example, they may claim that a transaction was unauthorized, even though they themselves made the purchase.

Prevention and detection: acquirers and payment processors employ various fraud prevention measures, such as fraud detection algorithms, address verification systems, and 3D Secure (a protocol designed to provide an additional layer of security for online credit and debit card transactions). These measures are aimed at reducing the incidence of fraud-related chargebacks.

It's important to note that while credit card chargebacks are a mechanism to protect consumers from unauthorized or fraudulent transactions, they can also be abused. Merchants must strike a balance between providing good customer service and avoiding fraudulent chargebacks, as excessive chargebacks can result in financial penalties and reputational damage.



# Get your hands dirty

1. Analyze the data provided and present your conclusions (consider that all transactions are made using a mobile device).

1.Answer

Analyzing the data, I could understand that some transactions were marked as chargebacks because of achieving a threshold, that can be for example 10k for the merchant_id 99510 and also we can see that some other transactions were marked as chargebacks because they were made within a short period of time.

Also, we can infer that some customers have some spending habits, transaction frequency and typical transaction locations, so everything that seems unusual to that customer could be marked as a chargeback fraud.



2. In addition to the spreadsheet data, what other data would you look at to try to find patterns of possible frauds?

2.Answer

I would look at geolocation and IP, behavioral analysis and monitor the rate at which transactions are occurring for a single card or across multiple cards.
